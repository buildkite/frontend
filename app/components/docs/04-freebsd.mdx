You first need to ensure that both `git` and `bash` are installed on your server:

```shell
sudo pkg install bash git
sudo sh -c 'echo "fdesc /dev/fd fdescfs rw 0 0" >> /etc/fstab'
sudo mount -a

# The agent requires a version of bash to be available at: /bin/bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash

# If you want change your default shell to bash
sudo chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash `whoami`

# You now switch to bash
bash
```

Once they have been installed, you can run the following script ([view the source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildkite/agent/master/install.sh)), which will download and install the correct binary for your system and architecture:

```shell
TOKEN="{{props.token || 'INSERT-YOUR-AGENT-TOKEN-HERE'}}" bash -c "`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildkite/agent/master/install.sh`"
```

Then, start the agent:

```shell
~/.buildkite-agent/bin/buildkite-agent start
```
